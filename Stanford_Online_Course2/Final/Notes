Minimum Bottleneck spanning tree (MBST) : MBST of a given graph is a spanning tree whose maximum edge weight is minimum among all the possible spanning trees. 	

The standard algorithm for finding Minimum Bottleneck Spanning Tree (MBST) is known as Cameriniâ€™s algorithm

5. Our Goal: Divide the n items up into k groups so that the minimum distance between items in different groups is maximized.
