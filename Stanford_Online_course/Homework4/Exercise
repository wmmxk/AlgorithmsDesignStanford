Question 1:
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, where each vertex maintains an array of its outgoing edges (but *not* its incoming edges), how long does it take, in the worst case, to compute the in-degree of a given vertex?

As usual, we use n and m to denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively, of the given graph. Also, let k denote the maximum in-degree of a vertex. (Recall that the in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges that enter it.)


a:[b,c]
b:[a,c]
c:[a,b]
